\begin{abstract}
While mutation testing has been a topic of academic interest for
decades, it is only recently that ``real-world'' developers, including
industry leaders such as Google and Meta, have adopted mutation
testing.  In this paper we propose a new approach to the development of mutation
testing tools, and in particular the core challenge of
\emph{generating mutants}.  Current practice tends towards two
limited approaches to mutation generation: mutants are either (1)
generated at the bytecode/IR level, and thus neither human readable
nor adaptable to source-level features of languages or projects, or
(2) generated at the source level by language-specific tools that are
hard to write and maintain, and in fact are often abandoned by both
developers and users.  We propose instead that source-level mutation
generation is a special case of \emph{program transformation} in
general, and that adopting this approach allows for a single tool that
can effectively generate source-level mutants for essentially
\emph{any} programming language. Furthermore, by using \emph{parser
  parser combinators} many of the seeming limitations of an
any-language approach can be overcome, without the need to parse
specific languages.  We compare the universal program transformation
approach to mutation to existing tools, and demonstrate the advantages
of using parser-parser combinators to improve on a simple regular-expression
based approach to generation.  The ease of building new tools is
further demonstrated by showing that the implementation of a recently
published mutation tool for Coq can be duplicated using only XX
transformation rules, without parsing the Coq language.

\section{Introduction}

\section{The Universal Source-Based Approach}

\subsection{Incremental Mutation}

One obvious concern with any-language source-based mutation is that every time the
program changes, the cost of invalid mutations must be paid again.
However, the locality of mutants and source changes in fact means this
is seldom required.

The {\tt git merge-file} utility takes a base file and two modified
versions of that file, and produces an automatic merge, using the
usual git merge resolution algorithm.    Because a mutant is a (very
small) source change, this means that in practice updating a mutant to
reflect even large changes to a source file is cost-free, and if the
original mutant was valid, the new mutant will usually also be valid.
New mutant generation is only required for new lines of code and
modified lines of code.  To the extent development is incremental,
therefore, mutation generation can also be incremental.

\section{Related Work}

Many approaches have been proposed to tackle the \emph{computational} cost of mutation, including weak-mutation, 
meta-mutation, mutation-sampling, and predicting which mutants will be
killed~\cite{offuttMutant1996,
  untch1993mutation,KaufmanFAKAJ2022,zhang2016pmt}.  Approaches to reducing the cost of
mutation analysis were categorized as \textit{do smarter}, \textit{do
faster}, and \textit{do fewer} by Offutt et al.~\cite{offutt2001mutation}.
The \textit{do smarter} approaches include space-time trade-offs, weak
mutation analysis, and parallelization of mutation analysis. The \textit{do
faster} approaches include mutant schema generation, code patching, and
other methods to make mutants run faster. Finally, the
\textit{do fewer} approaches try to reduce the number of mutants examined,
and include selective mutation and mutant sampling.

None of these approaches focus on the cost in \emph{human} time to
develop and maintain mutation testing tools.  In fact, the complexity
and sophistication of some of these approaches imposes a daunting
barrier to those who would develop ``good'' mutation tools for a new
language.  However, arguably the most powerful and generalizable
methods for reducing the cost of mutation, such as random sampling~\cite{GopinathSampleSize,gopinath2017mutation} and
predictive mutation testing~\cite{zhang2016pmt,kim2022predictive}, are independent of the generation of
mutants and so applicable to any language.

Hariri et al. compared C mutation approaches at the source and
compiler IR levels~\cite{CompareSrcBinary} and found that overall
source level mutation was better, producing fewer mutants overall, but
matching the IR approach in the important measures of surface and
minimal mutants and overall mutation score.  Numerous studies compare
Java mutation tools~\cite{MajorPIT,gopinath2017does}, including a
recent article for a more general audience in Communications of the
ACM~\cite{CommACMJavaTool} (perhaps showing the growing interest in
practical mutation testing).  This paper showed that users
considered active maintenance, support for a variety of testing
frameworks, and support for recent Java versions as the most important
features in a Java mutation tool.  The approach proposed in this paper
by its nature tends to promise all three of these key factors without
imposing onerous burdens on maintainers.

Finally, the practical use of mutation testing at Google argues that
support for a variety of languages is critical, and that the approach
we take is more than sufficient.  Google has used its
substantial resources to provide mutation generation for C++, Java,
Python, Javascript, Go, Typescript, and Common
Lisp~\cite{PetrovicMutationGoogle}, all of which we also support.  The
operators Google uses for these
languages (based on the original Mothra operators~\cite{offutt1996experimental}) are a subset of those provided by our implementation, with the caveat
that statement block removal is only supported when using Comby;
regular expression mutation is limited to single-line statement
deletion.  For Lisp-like languages, the difficulty of identifying statements vs. value-returning
function calls makes use of block deletion somewhat impractical, but
still easy to implement.  The majority of the Google Mothra operators
can be implemented in
a few lines as universal rules for all languages; only specializing
logical operators and implementing block/statement deletion even requires
language identification.  Unlike Google's mutation infrastructure, our tool is open source, easily extensible, and not tied to any particular development environment.
